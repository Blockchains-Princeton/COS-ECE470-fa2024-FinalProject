{"prompt":"Project 1 README:\n","completion":" # Bitcoin Client Project, Part 1\n\nHi, welcome! This is your first assignment in this course. This assignment aims to help you familiarize yourself with the **Rust** programming language. We will use Rust throughout this course, so it is a good idea to start learning it as early as possible.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe expect you to have some programming experience and are familiar with at least one programming language. If you don't know Rust language, it is totally okay since in this assignment, you'll self-teach Rust language by reading the documents of:\n\n- the Rust language itself;\n- Cargo, the rust package manager, and building tool;\n- Rust standard libraries;\n- Rust crates.\n\nThen you will finish simple tasks in the codebase we provide. We divide the project into several sub-projects. This is the first part of the project.\nIf you are already familiar with Rust, this simple assignment will take less than 30 minutes!\n\nIn this course project, you will build a simplified Bitcoin client. The client's goal is not to run in the Bitcoin mainnet or any public testnet. Instead, the goal is to run it inside your team and let you have fun with it. You have plenty of freedom in designing and implementing this project.\n\n## Repository management and submission:\n1. You can work on the project in groups of 2 or 3. Only one submission per group. Please list your netids in [netids.txt](..\/netids.txt)\n2. This repo provides the codebase for assignments. Please make a new **private** repo, e.g. hebbarashwin\/COS-ECE470-fa2024 (Please do not change the name of the repo). Import code from https:\/\/github.com\/Blockchains-Princeton\/COS-ECE470-fa2024.git.\n3. You can run tests (by command `cargo test`) provided in the code to check the validity of their implementation. However, passing these tests doesn't guarantee to get full grades. \n4. Push to your GitHub repo's **main** branch (Please use `gitignore` file to avoid pushing unnecessary files! Specifically, the `target` directory should not be pushed), and click `Code -> Download ZIP' on GitHub to download a zip file. **Avoid zipping your code on your computer since the directories or files on your computer may cause an error for auto-grading.**\n5. Before submitting your code, you can double-check by running the auto-grading script we provide to make sure we can auto-grade your code. (Details below.) \n6. Rename it to `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas. Please ensure that the file size <2MB.\n7. TAs will put additional tests (private) to the auto-grader and run them to award marks.\n\n## Reading \nPlease refer to [Rust by example](https:\/\/doc.rust-lang.org\/rust-by-example\/) to learn Rust grammar.\n\nPlease refer to [https:\/\/doc.rust-lang.org\/cargo\/](https:\/\/doc.rust-lang.org\/cargo\/) to learn Cargo, the Rust package manager, and building tool. After reading chapter 1, you'll be able to install Rust and Cargo and run a Rust project.\n\nFor [Rust standard crate](https:\/\/doc.rust-lang.org\/stable\/std\/), we recommend you learn two very important structs: **String** and **Vec**.\n\nYou can learn about other public crates here: [https:\/\/docs.rs\/](https:\/\/docs.rs\/). A *crate* just means a library or a package and can be managed by Cargo. You will learn how to use the following crate:\n- [ring](https:\/\/docs.rs\/ring\/0.16.20\/ring\/), a cryptographic crate. Specifically, you need to learn how to do SHA256 hash.\n- [serde](https:\/\/docs.rs\/serde\/1.0.104\/serde\/) and [bincode](https:\/\/docs.rs\/bincode\/1.2.1\/bincode\/), serialization crates. Specifically, you need to learn how to encode an object into bytes.\n\nFor these crates, their GitHub page or homepage may also be helpful. Feel free to read them.\n\n## Warmup\nPlease complete these short exercises from [rustlings](https:\/\/github.com\/rust-lang\/rustlings\/tree\/main) on the Rust playground.\nOnce you pass all the tests, *copy your solution to the respective file in [rustlings_exercises](..\/rustlings_exercises\/)*. (No additional tests will be run for this warmup section during grading)\n\n1.

The following files are related to this assignment.\n\n_src\/types\/address.rs_ - Provides __Address__ struct (20 byte array).\n\n_src\/types\/transaction.rs_ - struct defition of **Transaction** struct and function declaration for __sign()__ and __verify()__ .\n\nAs for other files in the repo, you don't have to worry about them in this assignment. They may appear in future assignments\/projects.\n\n## Programming\nAfter you fork this repo, we first suggest running the command `cargo test` to see whether the code is compiling on your machine. (If compilation has errors, please check if you are running the latest stable version of Cargo.) If the compiling is successful, you will see something like this:\n```\nrunning X tests\ntest XXX ... FAILED\ntest XXX ... FAILED\n```\nIt's expected that tests fail with the code we provide. After you finish this assignment, some of the tests will pass. We encourage you to add your own tests to your code as well.\n\nThese are the tasks of this assignment:\n\n1. You need to implement the missing parts in file _src\/types\/address.rs_:\n\n- `fn from_public_key_bytes(bytes: &[u8])`\n\n- It uses SHA256 (from **ring** crate (version >= 0.16.20)) to hash the input bytes, and takes the last 20 bytes, and converts them into a __Address__ struct. The code now contains `unimplemented!()`, and you can delete it and write your own code.\n\n- We provide a small test function named **from_a_test_key()**. After you finish coding, you can run `cargo test from_a_test_key` and see this function's result in the output. It will look like the following.\n```\ntest types::address::test::from_a_test_key ... ok\n```\n- To test your code, you are free to write more tests.\n\n2. The missing parts in file _src\/types\/transaction.rs_: \n\n- Fill in the **Transaction** struct. We don\u2019t expect the cryptocurrency and payment to be functional at this point, so you can put any content in transactions. A simple choice is to put **sender**, **receiver**, and **value** inside transactions. **sender**, **receiver** are of type **Address** and **value** is integer.\n- Fill in the `sign` and `verify` functions. These two functions should sign and verify the digital signature of the **Transaction** struct. Please use **ring** (version >= 0.16.20) crate. You can use the [bincode](https:\/\/docs.rs\/bincode\/latest\/bincode\/) crate to serialize and deserialize any struct. The code we provide contains some `unimplemented!()` and you can delete it and write your own code.\n- A tricky part about transaction and signature is how you put them together. Hence, we provide another struct called **SignedTransaction**. You can let this struct have a transaction, a signature, and a public key that creates the signature. Notice that crate *ring*'s signature and public key structs may not be very convenient to use, so you can convert them to a vector of bytes: `let signature_vector: Vec<u8> = signature.as_ref().to_vec();`\n- For testing, you need to fill in the function **generate_random_transaction()**, which will generate a random transaction on each call. It should generate two different transactions on two calls. We require this since we frequently use this function in our tests and grading. Again, there is `unimplemented!()` and you can delete it.\n- We provide a small test function named **sign_verify()**. After you finish, you can run `cargo test sign_verify` \/ `sign_verify_two` and see this function's result in the output. It will look like the following.\n```\ntest types::transaction::tests::sign_verify ... ok\n```\n- To test your code, you are free to write more tests.\n\n## Double check (Unix)\nWe have provided an (incomplete) auto-grader to test that your code format fits the auto-grader. However, passing this auto-grader doesn't guarantee to get full grades. For this assignment, put your netid1_netid2_netid3.zip file with [autograder.sh](autograder.sh) and [add_test.py](add_test.py) in a new directory, from where run\n```\nbash autograder.sh\n```\nYou can open the output file _log.txt_and see whether your code passes the auto-grader tests. Requirements to run the double-check: `bash`, `unzip`, `python3`.\n\nIf you see \"Code format wrong\" on the screen, it may be due to changing these lines in the code: `\/\/ DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT, IT IS FOR AUTOGRADER.`\n\nIf in _log.txt_ you cannot see the correct log; your zip file may have incorrect directories for the auto-grader to compile. Any compilation errors would be in _build_log.txt_ file that gets created in the folder.\n\n## Double check (windows)\nSimilar to the Unix double-checking auto-grader, we have provided `autograder_windows.bat`. First, you need to unzip your netid1_netid2_netid3.zip file manually and put the `COS-ECE470-fa2024-main` folder inside a folder named after your netid. Put the folder `your-netid` in the a new folder containing [autograder.sh](autograder.sh) and [add_test.py](add_test.py). Make sure that `Cargo.toml` and `src\/` is in `your-netid\/COS-ECE470-fa2024-main`. Then double click `autograder_windows.bat`, enter your netid as instructed, and the result will be shown in a cmd window.\n\nYou need to install `python3` to run it.\n## Submission\nDownload the zip file of your repo on GitHub. Rename it to your netids as `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas. Please ensure that the file size is <2MB.\n\n\n## Advance Notice\n- At the end of the course, you will implement a functional cryptocurrency client based on this codebase. So it is helpful to get familiar with this codebase.\n- This code base provides other files that will help you build a blockchain client. If you want to run the main program and see what is going on, you can run `cargo run -- -vv`. Currently, the main program is just stuck in a loop. (`-vv` is for level 2 logging. You can have `-vvv` for level 3.)\n- At the end of the project, you will implement a functional cryptocurrency client. In this assignment, we provide a temporary transaction structure that contains sender, receiver, and value. You can think of a transaction struct that can support a real cryptocurrency; also, explore how Bitcoin and Ethereum do this.\n"}
{"prompt":"Project 2 README:\n","completion":" # Bitcoin Client Project, Part 2\nIn this assignment, you will implement some crypto-primitives and basic data structures. You will need the code that we provide in this repo. Please follow the instructions.\n\n## Repository management and submission:\n1. Similar to the previous assignment, you can continue to work on your GitHub repo. After pushing to your GitHub repo, click `Code -> Download ZIP' to download a zip file.\n2. Rename it to your netid as `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas. Please ensure that the file size <2MB.\n3. TAs will put additional tests (private) on the submission and run them to award marks.\n\n## Code provided\nWe have provided incomplete code for implementing some crypto-primitives and data structures like merkle tree. The following files are related to this assignment, and you should read them.\n1. _src\/types\/hash.rs_ - Provides __H256__ struct(32 byte array),  __Hashable__ trait, with its implementation for H256. (You don't need to write anything in this file.)\n\n2. _src\/types\/merkle.rs_ - struct definition of **MerkleTree** struct and the related function declaration. You will write your code in this file.\n\nThe other files in the repo are not relevant to this assignment. They may appear in future assignments\/projects.\n\n## Programming\nYou need to implement the missing parts in the code. They include the following.\n\n### Merkle Tree\nThis part is in file *src\/types\/merkle.rs*. You need to complete the Merkle tree struct and some functions. Please read this [article](https:\/\/nakamoto.com\/merkle-trees\/) about Merkle trees. Specifically, the functions you need to implement are:\n1. *new()* - This function takes a slice of Hashable data as input and creates the Merkle tree. \n2. *root()* - given a Merkle tree, return the root. The root should be computed in *new()*; this function should just return it.\n3. *proof()* - given a Merkle tree, and an index (starts from 0), this function returns the proof in the form of a vector of hashes. The proof must return a list of sibling hashes of the index-specified data point, where there is a sibling at each tree level (It should not include the leaf and root). \n4. *verify()* - given a root, a hash of datum, a proof (a vector of hashes), an index of that datum (same index in *proof()* function), and a leaf_size (the length of leaves\/data in *new()* function), returns whether the proof is correct.\n\nThe examples in the ring documentation ([ring::digest](https:\/\/docs.rs\/ring\/0.5.3\/ring\/digest\/fn.digest.html), [ring:;signature](https:\/\/docs.rs\/ring\/0.16.20\/ring\/signature\/index.html)) is a useful reference.\n\n*new()* function can take any Hashable data, however we will test the Merkle tree using inputs of type **H256**. The Hashable trait for H256 is already provided in *src\/types\/hash.rs*.\n\nIf the size of the input to *new()* is not a power of 2, you need the following extra steps to create the Merkle tree :\n> Whenever a tree level has an odd number of nodes, duplicate the last node to make the number even.\n\nWe have provided a few simple test functions in this file, and you can run `cargo test`. In these test functions, we also briefly explain the expected computation. \nWe highly recommend you (learn to) write your own test cases to verify your implementation before submission.\n## Grading\n\nAfter you finish the programming, you can run `cargo test merkle_root` \/ `merkle_proof` \/ `merkle_verifying` to test whether your implementation is working.\n\nWe will auto-grade the program using tests similar to the ones mentioned above. We will not test edge cases. We encourage you to write your own test cases to ensure that your implementation is correct.\n\n## Double check\nWe have provided an (incomplete) auto-grader to test that your code format fits the auto-grader. However, passing this auto-grader doesn't guarantee to get full grades. For this assignment, put your netid1_netid2_netid3.zip file with [autograder.sh](autograder.sh) and [add_test.py](add_test.py) in a new directory, from where run\n```\nbash autograder.sh\n```\nYou can open the output file _log.txt_ and see whether your code passes the auto-grader tests. Requirements to run the double-check: `bash`, `unzip`, `python3`.\n\nIf you see \"Code format wrong\" on the screen, it may be due to changing these lines in the code: `\/\/ DO NOT CHANGE THIS COMMENT, IT IS FOR AUTOGRADER.`\n\nIf in _log.txt_ you cannot see the correct log; your zip file may have incorrect directories that prevents the auto-grader from compiling.\n\n## Double check (windows)\nSimilar to the Unix double-checking auto-grader, we have provided `autograder_windows.bat`. First, you need to unzip your netid1_netid2_netid3.zip file manually and put the `COS-ECE470-fa2024-main` folder inside a folder named after your netid. Put the folder `your-netid` in the a new folder containing [autograder.sh](autograder.sh) and [add_test.py](add_test.py). Make sure that `Cargo.toml` and `src\/` is in `your-netid\/COS-ECE470-fa2024-main`. Then double click `autograder_windows.bat`, enter your netid as instructed, and the result will be shown in a cmd window.\n\nYou need to install `python3` to run it.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- *What data structure should one use to implement the Merkle tree?* \n    - We recommend avoiding a recursive implementation. You can use any suitable data structure; a simple choice would be to use `Vec<>` or `Vec<Vec<>>`.\n- *How do I handle edge cases?* \n     - We will not be testing edge cases. However, here are a few suggestions:\n         - When `data.len() = 0`, your program should not panic. `root()` can return a (fake) value like `0x000...0`. `verify()` must return `false`.\n         - When `data.len() = 1`, the merkle root will be the hash of the datum.\n- *Should I handle invalid inputs?* \n     - Yes; however only valid inputs will be tested during grading.\n         - If `index >= data.len()`, `verify()` must return `false`.  `proof()` can return an empty vector."}
{"prompt":"Project 3 README:\n","completion":" # Bitcoin Client Project, Part 3\n\nIn this part of the project, you will implement the **Block** struct and the **Blockchain** struct.\n\n## Repository management and submission\n\n1. Like the previous assignments, use GitHub and download the zip file. Rename it to your netids as `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas.\n2. TAs will put additional tests (private) on the submission and run them to award marks.\n\n## Code provided\nWe have provided started code in this repository. The following files are related to this assignment.\n1. *src\/types\/block.rs* - Please finish the **Block** struct and some related functions in this file.\n2. *src\/blockchain\/mod.rs* - Please finish the **Blockchain** struct and some related functions in this file. (You can also split codes into several files inside the directory *src\/blockchain\/*.)\n\n## Programming\n\n### Block\n\nYou need to define a **Block** similar to that in Bitcoin. We require that a block must include:\n1. parent - A hash pointer to the parent block. Please use **H256** that we provide.\n2. nonce - A random integer that will be used in proof-of-work mining. We suggest using **u32**.\n3. difficulty - The mining difficulty, i.e., the threshold in the proof-of-work check. Please use **H256**: since we have provided a comparison function, with which you can write `if hash <= difficulty`. (Proof-of-work check or mining is not required in this part.)\n4. timestamp - The timestamp at which this block is generated. (you can use `std::time`)\n5. merkle\\_root - the Merkle root of data (explained below in 6.).\n\nThe above fields are also known as **Header**. We suggest (but do not require) you create a struct **Header** to include them.\n\n6. data\/content - The actual transactions carried by this block. We suggest using a **Vec** of **SignedTransaction**. You have already written the SignedTransaction struct in a previous assignment.\n\nWe suggest (but do not require) you create a struct **Content** to include the content.\n\nNotice that to create the Merkle root of **SignedTransaction**, you must implement the trait **Hashable** for **SignedTransaction**. This trait should be implemented by serializing it into bytes, then calling SHA256 to hash the bytes.\n\nYou need to implement the trait **Hashable** for **Block**. The way to hash a block is to hash **Header** rather than **Content**. So you can first implement **Hashable** for **Header**. When you hash a **Block**, you can directly call the hash function of **Header**. Please make sure you serialize the **Header** before hashing it.\n\nTo test and debug, you must implement the function `generate_random_block()`. This function takes the hash of the parent block as an argument. The generated block should contain that *parent*. The *nonce* should be a random integer. You can let the content be empty. So merkle\\_root should be the Merkle root of an empty input (make sure this is accounted for in your Merkle implementation). As for fields such as difficulty and timestamp, choose whatever you like.\n\n### Blockchain\n\nYou need to finish a struct named **Blockchain**, which contains the necessary information of a direct acyclic graph (DAG) and provides functions related to the longest chain rule. The following functions are required:\n1. new() - Create a new blockchain that only contains the information of the genesis block. Define genesis block by yourself. \n2. insert() - insert a block into the blockchain. You can (but not required) make it return struct `Result` to enable error handling when an invalid block is inserted. (We will not deal with invalid blocks in this part)\n3. tip() - Return the last block's hash in the longest chain. The tip should be computed in the new and insert functions; this should just return it.\n4. all_blocks_in_longest_chain() - return all blocks' hashes in a vector from the **genesis to the tip**. This function will not be tested in this part and will be used in the future.\n\n#### Storage choice\n\nWe suggest you use a **HashMap** in the standard crate to store blocks. You can use the hash as the key and the block as the value. This enables you to look up the blocks by hash very conveniently.\n\nYou can also store the tip and update it after inserting a block. If, say, your current tip is hash(B1), and you insert a new block B2. You need to update the tip to hash(B2) if and only if the length of chain B2 is *strictly greater* than that of B1.\n\nYou may also store the length\/height of each block in the blockchain and use it to determine the longest chain. E.g., genensis block has height 0. This step is not required.\n\nYou can implement this with persistent storage, such as a database, but this is not the point of this project, and we suggest you use in-memory storage.\n\n#### Thread safety choice\n\nIn the future, the **Blockchain** struct will be shared between threads, such as miner and network threads. So this struct must be thread-safe. However, this is not hard to do with lock. **You don't need to worry about it in this part.** You can implement a non-thread-safe **Blockchain** and leave the thread safety problem to future parts.\n\n## Grading\n\nIf your program works, you will pass the test named *insert_one*. (By running `cargo test`.)\n\nWe will use other private tests to grade your submission. We will use the generate_random_block function that you implemented for tests.\nThe tests will insert around 50 blocks into a new blockchain and check whether the tip is correct. The tests contain forking\/branching scenarios to check the correctness of your longest chain rule. We encourage you to write your own tests to verify the correctness and avoid losing points.\n\nWe will *NOT* call the insert function with invalid blocks. Specifically, we will not insert a block whose parent is not already inserted.\n\n## Double check\nWe have provided an (incomplete) autograder. Same instructions as the previous parts.\n\n## FAQ\n- *Can the fields of Header\/Content structs of the blockchain be made public?* \n    - Yes, they can be made public. You can also define a `get` function instead.\n- *What values should the fields in the genesis block have?* \n    - Note that the fields (for the genesis block) such as nonce, difficulty, timestamp, parent should be fixed and not random. You can set nonce and timestamp to `0` and difficulty to `0xff..ff` and parent to `0x00..00` (or any other fixed values for that matter).\n- *How does one set values to a variable of type H256?* \n    - You can create a `[u8;32]` with fixed values and convert it to H256 using `.into()`. Alternatively, you can use the `hex_literal` crate and use `.into()`.\n\n## Advance Notice\n1. If you want to learn about thread safety of the Blockchain struct, you can try `Arc<Mutex<Blockchain>>` in your code.\n2. Our goal is to decouple blockchain status from ledger status and focus on the former. As a result, we don't involve transaction execution, ledger update, or UTXO in this part. They will be handled in future parts.\n3. We don't use proof-of-work check or mining yet, but we must prepare for them. So we require the fields nonce and difficulty inside a block. You can start to think about how to mine or check blocks.\n4. The Blockchain struct will be used in multiple places in the future. For example, when you implement a miner, you insert a mined block into the blockchain; when you want to mine on the longest chain, you need to get the tip as the block's parent; when you receive a block from p2p network, you insert it.\n5. We don't require you to put a coin base transaction inside blocks in this part.\n"}
{"prompt":"Project 4 README:\n","completion":" # Bitcoin Client Project, Part 4\n\nIn this part of the project, you will implement the **miner** module of the Bitcoin client. The miner will produce blocks that solve the proof-of-work puzzle.\n\n## Repository management and submission\n\n1. Like the previous assignments, use GitHub and download the zip file. Rename it to your netid as `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas.\n2. TAs will put additional tests (private) on the submission and run them to award marks.\n\n## Code provided\nThe following files are related to this assignment.\n- *src\/miner\/mod.rs* and *src\/miner\/worker.rs* - where the mining process takes place.\n- *src\/api\/mod.rs* - an API with which you can interact with your program when running.\n- *src\/main.rs* - the main function of the program. You need to read and change the code that creates a miner in this part.\n\nTo see how the code in these files works, you can run `cargo run -- -vv`, and you will see these logs in the terminal\n> Miner initialized into paused mode\n> \n> API server listening at 127.0.0.1:7000\n\nThis means the miner is not started yet; however, you can use API to start it. In a browser (or *curl* command), go to\nhttp:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/miner\/start?lambda=1000000\n\nThen you will see this log in the terminal\n> Miner starting in continuous mode with lambda 1000000\n\nThis means the miner is started and keeps working in the *main mining loop*. We also provide a parameter *lambda* and use it in the sleep function inside the main mining loop, to avoid excessive CPU usage. In the above example, lambda is 1000000 (microseconds), the miner will sleep for this duration after every iteration of the main mining loop.\n\n`-vv` in `cargo run -- -vv` means the level of logging is 2 (info). With `-vvv` the level is 3 (debug), and you can get more logs in the terminal.\n\n## Programming\n\nYou have seen that the miner is working in the *main mining loop*, so the programming goal for this part is to prepare the miner and implement the main mining loop.\n\n### Preparation for miner\n\nYou need to add the required components to **Context** struct in *src\/miner\/mod.rs*\n\nSpecifically, the miner needs the following,\n1. Blockchain. The miner calls *blockchain.tip()* and sets it as the parent of the block being mined. \n2. A receiver of *ControlSignal*. We want to control the miner to start\/stop mining. Also, sometimes, we need the miner to update the context, e.g., the parent of the block being mined. \n3. (Not required in this part) Memory pool. Miner takes transactions from the memory pool and sets them as the content.\n\nAfter the miner successfully generates a block, it sends the block to a channel *finished_block_chan*. We provide a struct named **Worker** that listens to this channel. The worker does the following:\n1. When a block is received from the channel, it needs to insert the block into the blockchain.\n2. It also uses a network server handle to broadcast the newly generated blocks' hashes. (Not required in this part.)\n\nHence, in this part, you need to add blockchain into miner **Context** and **Worker** struct. These structs run in different threads (cf. `thread::Builder::new`); hence we need the thread-safe wrapper of blockchain. Please follow these steps,\n1. Read the document of [Arc](https:\/\/doc.rust-lang.org\/std\/sync\/struct.Arc.html) and [Mutex](https:\/\/doc.rust-lang.org\/std\/sync\/struct.Mutex.html) in std crate of Rust.\n2. Add `Arc<Mutex<Blockchain>>` to the definition of miner **Context** and **Worker** struct.\n3. Add `blockchain: &Arc<Mutex<Blockchain>>` to the argument of *new()* functions. Inside *new()* functions, use `Arc::clone(blockchain)` to get a clone and pass it to the structs.\n\nFinally, you need to go to *src\/main.rs*, and change the code related to *new()* functions. You need to first create a new **Blockchain** (already implemented), turn it into `Arc<Mutex<Blockchain>>`, and pass this into *new()* functions.\n\n**Important**: To avoid deadlocks and related difficulty in future parts, consider the following [best practices](arc_mutex_best_practices.md)\n\n### Main mining loop\n\nThe main mining loop tries random nonces to solve the proof-of-work puzzle. We have provided the loop with some starter code. The actual mining logic may start from the \"TODO for student: actual mining\" comment.\n\nTo build a block, you need to gather a block's fields. In a block header, the fields are gathered as follows,\n1. parent - use *blockchain.tip()*. You can have a variable to store it and update it whenever you mine a new block. You could also update the tip when *ControlSignal::Update* is received (we have not implemented this control signal).\n2. timestamp - use `std::time`, you can refer to [this document](https:\/\/doc.rust-lang.org\/std\/time\/constant.UNIX_EPOCH.html). We suggest using millisecond as the unit rather than second, since second may be too coarse when we measure block delay in the future.\n3. difficulty - it should be computed from parent and ancestor blocks with some adaptive rule. In this project, we use the simple rule: a static\/constant difficulty: The difficulty of this block should be the same as that of the parent block. (Hence the difficulty will be set in the genesis block)\n4. Merkle root - compute it by creating a Merkle tree from the content, i.e., signed transactions.\n5. nonce - generate a random nonce (use *rand* crate) in every iteration, or increment nonce (say, increment by 1) in every iteration. PS do you think there is any difference in the probability of solving the puzzle?\n\nAs for the block content, you can put arbitrary content since we don't have a memory pool yet in this step. You can place an empty vector or some random transactions.\n\nAfter you have used these fields to build a block, just check whether the proof-of-work hash puzzle is satisfied by\n```\nblock.hash() <= difficulty\n```\n\nIf it is satisfied, the block is successfully generated. Congratulations! Just send the block to the channel *finished_block_chan*. And keep on mining for another block. Do not forget to update the parent of the block being mined to the tip of the blockchain!\n\n### Miner worker\nTo avoid writing an enormous struct and to make auto-grading feasible, we split the miner into two smaller modules, **Context** and **Worker**, and the latter has the following functionality.\n1. When a block is received from the channel *finished_block_chan*, it needs to insert the block into the blockchain.\n2. It also uses a network server handle to broadcast the newly generated blocks' hashes. (Not required in this part.) \n\nIn this part, you need to finish the first point.\n\n### Miner for test\nYou need to write a function `fn test_new() -> (Context, Handle, Receiver<Block>)` in *src\/miner\/mod.rs*, which creates a miner context, a miner handle, and a receiver for testing purposes. This function is called inside the auto-grader and should have no input parameter. It can simply be a one-liner of calling your *new()* function.\n\n## Grading\n\nAfter you finish the programming, you will have a program that can mine blocks and form a blockchain. You can run `cargo test miner_three_block` to test whether the miner can mine 3 blocks in a one-minute time limit.\n\nWe will auto-grade the program by testing whether the miner can mine 10 blocks within a one-minute time limit. (Parameter *lambda=0*.) To do that, you need to set a proper difficulty. Since we use static difficulty, it's sufficient to set that of the genesis block. (Recall that the genesis block is created when calling *Blockchain::new()*.) You can set it to be the largest hash `0xffff....ffff`. In code, you can use `[255u8; 32].into()`.\n\n## Double check\nWe have provided an (incomplete) autograder. Same instructions as the previous parts.\nPlease ensure that `test_new()` does not admit any arguments. This function will be called by the autograder.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- *My mined block is not being inserted by the worker* \n    - This may be a locking issue. When you call `blockchain = self.blockchain.lock().unwrap()`, the mutex lock will be held by this thread until it goes out of scope, or it is explicitly dropped. You may be facing a scenario where the worker thread is waiting for the miner loop thread to release the mutex lock before it can insert the block.\n    Please use scopes to ensure that the lock is dropped (Eg: `let tip = {self.blockchain.lock().unwrap().tip()};` instead of `let tip = self.blockchain.lock().unwrap().tip();`). \n    The lock can also be dropped using `drop()`. Eg: \n    ```let bc = self.blockchain.lock().unwrap(); let tip = bc.tip(); drop(bc);```)\n    (See [best practices](arc_mutex_best_practices.md) \n- *Should I create a new, empty blockchain in the `test_new()` function?* \n     - Yes.\n- *I pass the `miner_three_block` test case, but I face an error: `a thread 'miner' panicked at 'Send finished block error: \"SendError(..)\"`* \n     - This error comes up because the receiving end of finished_block_chan gets disconnected after the test function exits, but the miner is still running in another thread and sending blocks on the same channel. This is fine.\n\n\n## Advance notice\n1. Miner also needs a memory pool. We will cover them in the future.\n2. ControlSignal::Update will be used in the future.\n3. We will cover the network module in the next part.\n"}
{"prompt":"Project 5 README:\n","completion":" # Bitcoin Client Project, Part 5\n\nIn this part, you will implement the **network** module of the Bitcoin client. The network module is in charge of communicating with other nodes\/clients. It forms the peer-to-peer (p2p) network and uses a gossip protocol to exchange data, including blocks and transactions. (Transactions will not be covered in this part.)\n\n## Repository management and submission\n\n1. Similar to the previous assignments, use GitHub and download zip file. Rename it to your netids as `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas.\n2. TAs will put additional tests (private) on the submission and run them to award marks.\n\n## Code provided\nThe following files are related to this assignment.\n- *src\/network\/message.rs* - defines the types of messages.\n- *src\/network\/worker.rs* - defines the behavior after receiving messages.\n\nIn other files of *src\/network\/*, we provide a multithread TCP socket server. The default number of threads is 4, and you can change it by parameter `--p2p-workers`. To see how the network server works, you can start two processes of your program by running these two commands respectively\n```\ncargo run -- -vvv --p2p 127.0.0.1:6000 --api 127.0.0.1:7000\ncargo run -- -vvv --p2p 127.0.0.1:6001 --api 127.0.0.1:7001 -c 127.0.0.1:6000\n```\n\n`--p2p` parameter means that the first process will listen on 127.0.0.1:6000, and the second process will listen on 127.0.0.1:6001.\n\n`-c` parameter means that the second process will try to connect to 127.0.0.1:6000, which is the address of the first process.\n\nYou can see this log on the first process, indicating that the first process accepts connection from the second process.\n> New incoming connection from ...\n\nWe also provide an API to do ping\/pong. You can run\n`http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/network\/ping` to send a ping message from the first process to the second process. You will also see a debug log about the ping\/pong message.\n\nPing\/pong messages are defined in *src\/network\/message.rs*, and the behavior after receiving messages is defined in *src\/network\/worker.rs*. Please read them since you are going to write your own messages.\n\nNotice: the connection is bidirectional, so after process 2 connects to process 1, you don't need to make process 1 create another connection to process 2.\n\n## Programming\n\nYou will finish the behavior when a few message types are received.\n\n### Message types\n\nYou need to use these three message types. They have already been defined in *src\/network\/message.rs*.\n\n1. NewBlockHashes(Vec\\<H256\\>)\n2. GetBlocks(Vec\\<H256\\>)\n3. Blocks(Vec\\<Block\\>)\n\n### Gossip protocol\n\nYou need to define the gossip protocol, i.e., the behavior when messages are received, in *src\/network\/worker.rs*.\n\nFirst, you need to add a thread-safe wrapper of Blockchain into **Worker** struct in *src\/network\/worker.rs*. It is similar to [previous part](..\/Project4). Notice that the server we provide is a multithread one, so please be careful with thread safety.\n\nThen, you can define the gossip protocol as follows.\n1. For **NewBlockHashes**, if the hashes are not already in the blockchain, you need to ask for them by sending **GetBlocks**.\n2. For **GetBlocks**, if the hashes are in the blockchain, you can get these blocks and reply with a **Blocks** message.\n3. For **Blocks**, insert the blocks into the blockchain if they are not already in it. You must also broadcast a **NewBlockHashes** message if the blocks are new to this node. **NewBlockHashes** message should contain hashes of blocks newly received.\n4. Optional. If a block's parent is missing, put this block into a buffer and send **Getblocks** message. The buffer stores the blocks whose parent is not seen yet. When the parent is received, that block can be popped out from the buffer and inserted into the blockchain.\n\nHint: `peer.write()` and `self.server.broadcast()` may be useful to send a message. Also, make sure that the vectors of block hashes\/blocks that you are sending on the channels should be non empty. Add a check that sends these messages only if the content of the vectors is non-empty.\n\n### Combine with miner\n\nWhen a miner successfully generates a new block, broadcast the message **NewBlockHashes**. Hint: in _src\/miner\/worker.rs_, `self.server.broadcast()` may be useful. Also, in `main.rs`, make sure you give the same thread-safe blockchain instance to both miner and network worker.\n\n### Network for test\nYou need to write function `fn generate_test_worker_and_start() -> (TestMsgSender, ServerTestReceiver, Vec<H256>)` in *src\/network\/worker.rs* which creates structs for testing purpose. This function is called inside the auto-grader and should have no input parameter. We have provided a part of the function. You need to finish the part that adds **Blockchain** inside **Worker**, and return a vector of block hashes in the blockchain's longest chain (it could be just the genesis block hash).\n\n## Grading\n\nAfter you finish the programming, you will have a program that can connect to other peers and have the gossip protocol. You can run `cargo test reply_new_block_hashes` \/ `reply_get_blocks` \/ `reply_blocks` to test whether the gossip protocol is working.\n\nWe will auto-grade the program using tests similar to the ones mentioned above.\n\n## Double check\nWe have provided an (incomplete) autograder. Same instructions as the previous parts.\nPlease ensure that `generate_test_worker_and_start()` does not admit any arguments. This function will be called by the autograder.\n\n## FAQ\n- *How does one obtain a vector of hashes of all blocks for the generate_worker_and_start method?* \n     - Use the `all_blocks_in_longest_chain` function you had defined in a previous assignment. Note that the order in which the hashes should appear in the output should be from `[genesis,..,tip]`.\n- *Where should `peer.write()`  and where should `self.serve.broadcast()` be used?* \n     - `peer.write()` replies to only the peer from whom a message was received. This is useful in replying to targeted messages such as NewBlockHashes or GetBlocks. `self.server.broadcast()` sends message to all peers. This is useful to let all peers know you have added new blocks such as after mining or receiving new blocks from some peer.\n- *How does one test this code with the miner code written in previous part?* \n     - You can run two processes connected to each other and start the miner in one of them (see the two `cargo run` commands given at the start of this file and use `http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/miner\/start?lambda=1000000` to activate miner in the first node). Also print the number of blocks in the longest chain of each process and the block tip, or use `http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/blockchain\/longest-chain` and `http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7001\/blockchain\/longest-chain` to see the blocks in longest chain. If your broadcast code for the miner is working correctly and the network code is also working correctly, you should see the same blocks in both chains at any given time (i.e. the blocks mined by one of them would be added to the other).\n<!-- - *How should one structure the code for handling orphan blocks?* \n    - A simple way to do this is to initialize a orphan buffer HashMap before the `loop` starts in the worker. Instead of having a map from `hash` to `block`, it might be better to have a map from `parent hash` to `block`. In the `match` statement for `Message::Blocks`, check if the new processed block is a parent to any block in the orphan buffer. If that is the case, remove the block from the orphan buffer and process the block. This step should be done iteratively. I.e., once an orphan block is inserted, check if the orphan buffer has any of its children, and so on. -->\n\n## Advance notice\n1. When a block is received, it should be validated\/checked first. We will cover this in the future.\n2. Communication of transactions will be covered in the future.\n3. The buffer is optional in this part and will be covered in the next part.\n"}
{"prompt":"Project 6 README:\n","completion":" # Bitcoin Client Project, Part 6\n\nIn this part of the project, we will combine the last 3 weeks' work to make a functioning data blockchain. Most of this week's work will combine mining, network, and blockchain modules. You must add PoW validation and a block buffer to handle orphan blocks.\n\n## Repository management and submission\n\n1. Like the previous assignments, use GitHub and download the zip file. Rename it to your netids as `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas.\n2. TAs will use autograder to run your code to award marks.\n\n## Programming\n\n### Checks\nPlease add the following checks when processing a new block in *[src\/network\/worker.rs](..\/src\/network\/worker.rs)*.\n\n#### PoW validity check\n\nAdd code to check the PoW validity of a block by checking if:\n\n1. PoW check: check if `block.hash() <= difficulty`. (Note that difficulty is a misnomer here since a higher 'difficulty' here means that the block is easier to mine).\n2. Difficulty in the block header is consistent with your view. We have a fixed mining difficulty for this project; thus, this would just involve checking if the difficulty equals the parent block's difficulty. (This step should be done after parent check.)\n\n#### Parent check\n\n1. Check if the block's parent exists in your local copy of your blockchain; if the parent exists, add the block to your blockchain.\n2. If this check fails, you must add the block to an 'orphan buffer'. You may need to create a struct for this.\n3. If this check fails, also send **GetBlocks** message containing this parent hash. (This is the same as part 5 instructions.)\n\n#### Orphan block handler\n\nCheck if the new processed block is a parent to any block in the orphan buffer; if that is the case, remove the block from the orphan buffer and process the block. This step should be done iteratively: insertion of a block A enables the processing of a former orphan B, insertion of B may allow another former orphan block C to be processed, and so on.\n\n### Make sure modules of previous assignments work together\n\nMake sure that blockchain, miner, and network modules work well together. If it is working, you will have a data blockchain. We call this blockchain a data blockchain since we are not adding any meaningful transactions or transaction validation at this stage yet. (If you like, you can put data into transactions, which will be carried by blocks and be on-chain eventually.)\n\nThe program can mine and communicate blocks and reach consensus on the blockchain. Here, consensus means that when multiple nodes are connected and running, they should have the same blocktree (including the longest blockchain and other blocks not in the longest chain) and keep the chain growing.\n\n### API\n\nWe require an API named `\/blockchain\/longest-chain` to grade the program. It is already defined in this line in __src\/api\/mod.rs__\n```\n\"\/blockchain\/longest-chain\" => {\n```\n\nIt should output an array of strings in the hex format of block hashes in the longest chain. The order of block hashes should be number-ordered. That is, block 0 (genesis), followed by block 1, block 2, etc. The output should be in JSON format, and here is an example of JSON format:\n\n> [\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\"93b6a5b271bf03019da96d49506660dcdcad2376c3119c4cb9c47cb0f27fbbf1\"]\n\nPlease ensure this API works and outputs the correct JSON format since it is crucial for auto-grading. You can run your program by `cargo run` or directly run the binary in `target`. Then you can call `http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/blockchain\/longest-chain` in your browser or use a command like `curl` to check if it works.\n\n## Grading\n\nNow that we have a working blockchain program, we will auto-grade the program by running 3 nodes (processes) of it locally. Let's call them nodes A, B, and C. We will start nodes A, B, and C. We will connect node A to node B and node B to node C. Notice that nodes A and C are not connected.\n\nFor mining, we will start 3 nodes' miner with `lambda=0`. **You should choose a proper block difficulty in your code.** A suggestion is to have a _smaller_ difficulty so that the mining rate of blocks can be lower to reduce forking. (Below, we require >=10 blocks\/minute, and you can have a larger value, e.g., 20 blocks\/minute, to have higher confidence to meet our requirement.)\n\nLet them run for 5 minutes. Then we will use the API to check the longest chains in them. The grading is related to the comparison between the three nodes.\n\n1. Longest chain length: the min length of the three nodes. If it >=50, you get full grade for this item.\n2. Length difference: the max length - the min length. If it <=3, you get full grade for this item.\n3. Common prefix: these nodes should have the same longest chain, except for the few last blocks. If the number of different blocks at the end <=3, you get full grade for this item.\n\n## Double check\nWe do not provide any script for this assignment. You can double-check by following these procedures (which will be our grading procedures):\n\n1. Unzip your zip file by this command: `unzip -qq netid1_netid2_netid3.zip -d netid`, make sure your code is in this directory: `netid\/COS-ECE470-fa2024-main`.\n2. Run `cargo build`, which generates `netid\/COS-ECE470-fa2024-main\/target\/debug\/bitcoin`. It is the runnable binary of your code. (Windows may have `*.exe`, and it's ok.)\n3. Run three processes of this binary and remember to give different IP\/ports to them. For example, use these 3 commands:\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6000 --api 127.0.0.1:7000`\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6001 --api 127.0.0.1:7001 -c 127.0.0.1:6000`\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6002 --api 127.0.0.1:7002 -c 127.0.0.1:6001`\n4. Start mining by mining API, and let it run for 5 minutes. For example: (During grading we will use `lambda=0`)\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/miner\/start?lambda=1000000\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7001\/miner\/start?lambda=1000000\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7002\/miner\/start?lambda=1000000\n\n5. Use the `\/blockchain\/longest-chain` API to get the longest chain in 3 nodes\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/blockchain\/longest-chain\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7001\/blockchain\/longest-chain\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7002\/blockchain\/longest-chain\n6. Check whether the longest chains satisfy the aforementioned criteria.\n\n\n## FAQ\n- *How should difficulty be set?* \n     - During grading, the miner will be run with `lambda=0`. You should set a difficulty in the genesis block such that 10-20 blocks are mined per minute. Setting the difficulty to be too easy may result in excessive forking and the longest chains of the nodes not being in sync.\n     - You can use the `hex_literal` crate to set the difficulty (Eg: `let difficulty = hex!(\"ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\").into()`)\n- *Once started, how can one pause the miner?* \n     - You can use a very high value of `lambda` to pause mining, Eg: http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/miner\/start?lambda=100000000000\n- *The longest chains are not in sync, what might be the problem?*\n    - You can put print statements at different points of your code (miner, network messages) to check if a node is getting stuck somewhere (maybe waiting for a `blockchain.lock()` to be released - check this by adding a print statement before and after locking statements). Make sure you are using `drop(blockchain)` if you are using a locked blockchain in your network worker or miner.  \n     - The genesis block may have some randomness. It should be fully deterministic; this ensures all nodes start with the same genesis block.\n     - The network may be jammed due to too many messages, causing a delay: You may be sending a lot of empty `NewBlockHashes` messages. The difficulty may be set too easy resulting in too many blocks being mined.\n     - It may be easier to debug by starting with just two nodes with one of them mining. Decreasing the mining rate (by setting a larger lambda, or using a low value for `difficulty`) would also help debugging.\n- *How should one structure the code for handling orphan blocks?* \n    - A simple way to do this is to initialize a orphan buffer HashMap before the `loop` starts in the worker. Instead of having a map from `hash` to `block`, it might be better to have a map from `parent hash` to `block`. In the `match` statement for `Message::Blocks`, check if the new processed block is a parent to any block in the orphan buffer. If that is the case, remove the block from the orphan buffer and process the block. This step should be done iteratively. I.e., once an orphan block is inserted, check if the orphan buffer has any of its children, and so on.\n- *Is it okay if one fails the test cases of previous parts? (e.g. `reply_blocks_test`)* \n     - Yes, it is fine if you fail test cases of previous parts.\n\n## Advance notice\n1. In the next part, you will make the data meaningful, i.e., expressive for cryptocurrency operations.\n2. In this project, we don't consider handling spamming attacks. The orphan buffer may be spammed by blocks from an adversary (not a big issue with real PoW), but we don't require you to solve this problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Project 7 README:\n","completion":" # Bitcoin Client Project, Part 7\n\nThis part of the project will deal with including transactions in the codebase. Integrate the transaction structure inside the block content, add network functionality to transaction propagation, and add a transaction mempool to be used by the miner to include transaction content in the block being mined.\n\n## Repository management and submission\n\n1. Like the previous assignments, use GitHub and download the zip file. Rename it to your netids as `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas.\n2. TAs will use autograder to run your code to award marks.\n\n## Code provided\nWe have provided a starting code for the transaction generator *src\/generator\/generator.rs* . **Notice: starting from project part 6, we won't use tests to do autograding, so it is okay to fail previous tests.**\n\n## Programming\n\n### Transaction format\n\nYou are free to choose any format for transaction structure (modify your implementation in *src\/types\/transaction.rs* ). We recommend using a transaction structure that is either compatible with the UTXO model in Bitcoin or the account-based model in Ethereum. \n\n- UTXO model transaction: input contains the hash of the previous transaction and the index; output contains a recipient address and a value. It can support multiple inputs\/outputs in a transaction. You can refer to [Bitcoin](https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Transaction) transaction but don't need to adopt its complex scripting language.\n- Account-based model transaction: it should contain a recipient address, a value, and an account nonce. It only supports a single sender and single receiver. This should be simpler to implement than the UTXO model.\nThe account nonce is a transaction counter in each account.\n\n\nNow it's time to add the transaction and its **Signature** to **SignedTransaction**. As introduced in previous assignment, crate *ring*'s signature may not be very convenient to use, so you can convert them to vector of bytes: `let signature_vector: Vec<u8> = signature.as_ref().to_vec();`.  You must also add the signer's public key to **SignedTransaction**.\n\nRemember to implement the trait **Hashable** for **SignedTransaction**; you should have already finished that since a previous assignment requires it.\n\n### Transaction Mempool\n\nCreate a transaction **Mempool** structure to store all the received valid transactions which have not been included in the blockchain yet.\nIf a new transaction passes the validity checks (explained below), add it to the mempool.\n**Mempool** will also be used by miner to include transactions in the blocks being mined. The miner will add transactions in the mempool to the block till it reaches the block size limit (upper limit). You can choose the size limit by yourself (remember to meet the requirements in the **Grading** section). There is no lower limit on transactions, i.e., a block may contain no transactions. Upon processing a new block (which is not an orphan or stale), remove the corresponding transactions from the mempool.\n\nSimilar to **Blockchain**, you need the thread-safe wrapper `Arc<Mutex<>>` (The mempool will be used by the miner and network worker).\n\n### Transaction network messages\n\nAdd the following new messages and the procedures to process the message (which are similar to those of block-related messages):\n1. NewTransactionHashes(Vec<H256>), similar to NewBlockHashes\n2. GetTransactions(Vec<H256>), similar to GetBlocks\n3. Transactions(Vec<Transaciton>), similar to Blocks\n\n### Checks\nPlease add the following checks when receiving and processing a new transaction in *src\/network\/worker.rs*.\n\n#### Transaction signature check\n\n- Check if the transaction is signed correctly by the public key(s).\n\n- (Will not be tested or graded at this stage.) In the UTXO model, check that the public key(s) matches the owner(s)'s address of these inputs. In the account-based model, check if the public key matches the owner's address of the withdrawing account.\n\n#### Double spend checks\n\n- (Will not be tested or graded at this stage.) In the UTXO model, check if the inputs to the transactions are not double-spent. In the account-based model, check if the balance is enough and if the suggested account nonce equals one plus the current account nonce.\n\n#### Add those checks when processing blocks\n\nWhen receiving and processing a block, also check transactions inside it.\n\n### Transaction generator\n\nTo demonstrate transaction is working well with the client, you need to add transactions to your running client. The transactions can be a simple payment in the account-based model or a transaction with just one input and one output in the UTXO model. You are free to choose the sender and recipient.\n\nTo do that, you need to write a transaction generator:\n- create a new struct that starts a new thread and generates a transaction periodically,\n- set a parameter named `theta` that controls the speed of that (theta=0 means fastest transaction generation, we will use theta=100 in grading)\n- write an API in *src\/api\/* named `\/tx-generator\/start` and has parameter `theta`. This API should be very similar to `miner\/start`.\n\nWhen a transaction is generated, add the transactions to mempool and broadcast the hash to the network.\n\n**Since you are not storing state (will be covered in the next part), you can create transactions with any random content.**\n\n### API\n\nWe require an API named `\/blockchain\/longest-chain-tx` to grade the program. It is already defined but unimplemented in this line in __src\/api\/mod.rs__\n```\n\"\/blockchain\/longest-chain-tx\" => {\n```\n\nIt should output two layers of arrays of strings that are in the hex format of (signed) transaction hashes in the longest chain. The output should be in JSON format. For example, if the longest chain has block 0, block 1, and block 2. And block 0 (genesis block) contains no transaction; block 1 contains transactions whose hashes are \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\", \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002\" (the order of them matters); block 2 contains \"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a\". Then this example should output:\n\n> [[], [\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\", \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002\"], [\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a\"]]\n\nNotice that the API should not output all transactions in one array because we would think it is one block containing all transactions.\n\nPlease write this API and outputs the correct JSON format since it is crucial for auto-grading. You can run your program by `cargo run` or directly run the binary in `target`. Then you can call `http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/blockchain\/longest-chain-tx` in your browser or use a command like `curl` to check if it works.\n\n## Grading\n\nSimilar to the previous assignment, we will auto-grade the program by running 3 nodes (processes) of it locally. Let's call them nodes A, B, and C. We will start nodes A, B, and C. We will connect node A to node B and node B to node C. Notice that nodes A and C are not connected.\n\nFor mining, we will start 3 nodes' miner with `lambda=0`. You should choose a proper block difficulty in your code.\n\nFor the transaction generator, we will start 3 nodes' transaction generator with `theta=100`. You need to write a transaction generator so that with this theta, it generates enough transactions to meet the following grading criteria.\n\nLet them run for 5 minutes. Then we will use API to check the longest chain transactions in them. The grading is related to the comparison between the three nodes.\n\n1. Transaction throughput: the min count of transactions of the three nodes. If it >=500 (>=100 tx\/min), you get full grade for this item.\n2. Transactions per block: the average is taken over the blockchain, excluding the genesis block, then the min of three nodes is taken. If it >=10 and <=500, you get full grade for this item.\n3. No duplicate transactions: there should be no duplicate transactions in the blockchain. However, we relax the grading of this item. If the unique transaction count divided by the total transaction count >=0.9 for every node, you get full grade for this item.\n4. Common prefix: since it is already graded in the previous one, we relax the grading of this item. If the first transaction inside the second block of the three nodes is the same, you get full grade for this item. We use the second block since we exclude the genesis block.\n\n## Double check\nWe do not provide any script for this assignment. You can double-check by following these procedures (which will be our grading procedures):\n\n1. Unzip your zip file by this command: `unzip -qq netid1_netid2_netid3.zip -d netid`; make sure your code is in this directory: `netid\/COS-ECE470-fa2024-main`.\n2. Run `cargo build`, which generates `netid\/COS-ECE470-fa2024-main\/target\/debug\/bitcoin`. It is the runnable binary of your code. (Windows may have `*.exe`, and it's okay.)\n3. Run three processes of this binary and remember to give different IP\/ports to them. For example, use these 3 commands:\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6000 --api 127.0.0.1:7000`\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6001 --api 127.0.0.1:7001 -c 127.0.0.1:6000`\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6002 --api 127.0.0.1:7002 -c 127.0.0.1:6001`\n4. Start mining using the mining API, tx-generator using its API (`theta=100`), and let it run for 5 minutes :\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/tx-generator\/start?theta=100\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/miner\/start?lambda=0\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7001\/tx-generator\/start?theta=100\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7001\/miner\/start?lambda=0\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7002\/tx-generator\/start?theta=100\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7002\/miner\/start?lambda=0\n\n5. Use the `\/blockchain\/longest-chain-tx` API to get the longest chain transactions in 3 nodes :\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/blockchain\/longest-chain-tx\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7001\/blockchain\/longest-chain-tx\n- http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7002\/blockchain\/longest-chain-tx\n6. Check whether they satisfy the aforementioned criteria.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- *If a transaction within a block is invalid, should we discard the entire block?* \n     - Yes, this is because a honest miner would not mine a block with an invalid transaction.\n- *For this project, do we measure block size limit in bytes or in the number of transactions?* \n     - Block size limit is measured in the number of transactions.\n- *How should the transaction generator be implemented?* \n     - To implement the transaction generator you can create a new folder called `generator` and have a `mod.rs` and `worker.rs` similar to the `miner` folder. The only difference would be that this code would generate transactions instead of blocks. In `main.rs`, this generator would share the same `server` as the miner and network worker. Alternatively, you can use the provided codebase in *src\/generator\/generator.rs* ; the TransactionGenerator object can be directly passed to the api server which can call txgen.start(theta). \n- *If the blockchains were in sync for the Part 6 but diverges in this part after the introduction of transaction generator, what might be the problem?* \n    - You can put print statements within the new code you added to see if a node is getting stuck somewhere (maybe waiting for a blockchain.lock() to be released). Make sure you are using `drop(mempool)` or `drop(blockchain)` if you are using a locked mempool or blockchain in your network worker, miner or transaction generator. Also start with just two nodes with one of them mining, would help you better in debugging. Decreasing the mining rate would also help debugging. You can also make the transaction rate slower by setting the variable `interval` in `thread::sleep(interval)` to be `theta*x` where `x` can be adjusted manually. Also, if many blocks in your longest chain are empty, then you can put a condition in the miner to mine a block only when at least one transction has been included in the block.\n- *If we remove transactions from the mempool then how do we prevent duplicate transactions?* \n    - Double spend checks will be done in Part 8.\n\n\n## Advance notice\n1. In the next part, we need to add state validity to the transaction, which corresponds to the double spend checks.\n2. We will do ICO in the next part.\n"}
{"prompt":"Project 8 README:\n","completion":" # Bitcoin Client Project, Part 8\n\nThis is the last part of the project, and you will finish the Bitcoin client. You need to maintain a state for the ledger that the blockchain creates and add all the necessary checks related to it. \n\n## Repository management and submission\n\n1. Like the previous assignments, use GitHub and download the zip file. Rename it to your netid as `netid1_netid2_netid3.zip`. Upload the zip file on canvas.\n2. TAs will use autograder to run your code to award marks.\n\n## Code provided\nNo additional code will be provided for this assignment. **Notice: starting from project part 6, we won't use tests to do autograding, so it is okay to fail previous tests.**\n\n## Programming\n\n### Transaction Checks\nIn the last part, you included transactions into blocks. To prevent misbehavior such as double spending, you need to add the following checks:\n\n#### Transaction signature check\n- Check if the transaction is signed correctly by the public key(s).\n- In the UTXO model, check if the public key(s) matches the owner(s)'s address of these inputs. (This step needs struct **State**, see below.)\n- In the account-based model, check if the public key matches the owner's address of the withdrawing account. (This step needs struct **State**, see below.)\n\n#### Spending check\n- In the UTXO model, check if the inputs to the transactions are not spent, i.e. exist in **State** (see below). Also, check that the values of inputs are not less than those of outputs.\n- In the account-based model, check if the balance is enough and if the suggested account nonce equals one plus the account nonce. This check also needs **State** (see below).\n\nYou should also consider cases where each individual transaction may be valid; but cannot be valid together in the same block.\n### State\n\nLedger state, or **State**, is a collection of all the required information to check transactions.  \n\n- In the UTXO model, **State** should contain all the unspent transaction outputs. The format of an unspent transaction output may contain *(transaction hash, output index, value, recipient)*. Output index refers to the index in transactions (remember transactions are multi-output.) Recipient refers to the recipient address of that output and is used as the owner of that unspent transaction output.\n- In the account-based model, **State** should contain all the accounts' information. It may have *(account address, account nonce, balance)*.\n\nTo access data conveniently, **we recommend using a HashMap to store State**. In the UTXO model, we recommend `HashMap<(transaction hash, output index), (value, recipient)>`. In the account-based model, we recommend `HashMap<account address, (account nonce, balance)>`.\n\n#### State update\nWhen executing a block, i.e., executing transactions in that block, we need to update the state.\n- In the UTXO model, remove those *inputs*, and add *outputs* to the state.\n- In the account-based model, change the accounts' nonce and balance. Create new accounts if required.\n\n#### Initial state (ICO)\nYou can do an initial coin offering (ICO) by inserting an entry into **State** struct. **The grading section requires the ICO to insert exactly one entry.**\n- In the UTXO model, add unspent transaction outputs and specify the recipients to be the addresses you control.\n- In the account-based model, create accounts whose addresses are under your control.\n\n#### State per block\nSince there is branching\/forking in the blockchain, and the longest chain may change, you need to store one copy of **State** for each block. A copy of **State** for a block refers to the state after executing the block. We recommend using HashMap-like storage, e.g., `HashMap<block hash, state>`. When you check transactions, you can get the corresponding state from it. When you update the state, you do the update on a new state copy, and insert it.\n\nAnother way to deal with forking is to implement a reverse state transition corresponding to a transaction. Say the longest chain changes from A->B->C->D to A->B->E->F->G, you can perform reverse state transition on blocks D and C and a forward state transition from blocks E, F, G. This method is more complex than the previous one.\n\n### Transaction generator\nThe transaction generator should generate transactions that pass the checks. It can read the blockchain and the state to ensure this. On different nodes\/processes, the transaction generator should control different key pairs.\n\n### Transaction Mempool update\nAfter implementing the state transition, ensure that the transactions in the mempool are valid with respect to the new state; this is necessary since some transactions may classify as double-spends after the state update, and you may need to remove those transactions.\n\n### API\n\nTo grade the program, we require an API named `\/blockchain\/state?block=`.\n\nIt should output a representation of the state at a certain block in the longest chain. The output should be a JSON format array. For example, `\/blockchain\/state?block=10` should output the state at block 10 in the longest chain (suppose the chain is longer than 10). The state representation should be different for UTXO and account-based models.\n\n- UTXO model: all the unspent transaction output entries should be in an array, like the following example that has three entries:\n\n<!-- > [\"UTXO1\",\"UTXO2\",\"UTXO3\"] -->\n`[\"(ef307355202461e57e08b40c0c024440b468518ef9b4a8770b288a75a94e3f8b, 2, 5, 71fa98fadbe1da07384165aa31eb069044060209)\",\"(ef307355202461e57e08b40c0c024440b468518ef9b4a8770b288a75a94e3f8b, 1, 234, 896e9556ea1dc78ca55c236d6f6a5f81bff13dfd)\",\"(9f1c534efb06233235a89a35f264aaf83ed2b991c7b79e114600c39021622bad, 0, 8645, 71fa98fadbe1da07384165aa31eb069044060209)\",]`\n<!-- (\"UTXO1\" is a placeholder for your entry representation.) And make sure to include \"transaction hash, output index, value, recipient\" 4-tuple in the unspent transaction output entry representation. This 4-tuple should be converted to a **single string**. -->\n\nEach UTXO representation should include \"transaction hash, output index, value, recipient\" 4-tuple.\n\n- Account-based model: all accounts' information should be in an array, like the following example that has three entries:\n\n> `[\"(d5025bb3b5085be913b0778c82f5c73aa831ed2c, 1, 985035)\",\"(a0d741628fc826e09475d341a780acde3c4b8070, 2, 14965)\", \"(4r5tghb6b608hbttyb50778c8255cr56a8315t67, 2, 13542)\"]`\n\n<!-- (\"Account1\" is a placeholder for your entry representation.) And make sure to include \"address, account nonce, balance\" 3-tuple in the account information representation. This 3-tuple should be converted to a **single string**.  -->\nEach account information representation should include \"address, account nonce, balance\" 3-tuple.\n\nPlease refer to the code of parsing `lambda` for miner API, and use a similar logic to parse the parameter `?block=10`.  Please ensure this API outputs the correct JSON format, since it is crucial for auto-grading. You can run your program by `cargo run` or directly run the binary in `target`. Then you can call http:\/\/127.0.0.1:7000\/blockchain\/state?block=10 or another number in your browser or use a command like `curl` to check if it works.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNow that you have finished the last part, you have a simplified Bitcoin client! With a transaction generator simulating users' transactions, the system should run smoothly and securely.\n\n## Grading\n\n(Grading setting is the same as the previous assignment.) We will auto-grade the program by running 3 nodes (processes) of it locally. Let's call them nodes A, B, and C. We will start nodes A, B, and C. We will connect node A to node B and node B to node C. Notice that nodes A and C are not connected.\n\nFor ICO, we require only one UTXO entry (UTXO model) or only one account (account-based model). As the state evolves, new UTXO entries or accounts should be created.\n\nFor mining, we will start 3 nodes' miner with `lambda=0`. You should choose a proper block difficulty in your code.\n\nFor transaction generator, we will start 3 nodes' transaction generator with `theta=100`. You need to write a transaction generator so that with this theta, it generates enough transactions to meet the following grading criteria.\n\nLet them run for 5 minutes. Then we will use API to check the states in them. We will use `\/blockchain\/state?block=0` (the genesis state at ICO), `\/blockchain\/state?block=10` and `\/blockchain\/state?block=20`. The grading is related to the comparison between three nodes.\n\n1. The initial state after ICO should contain <=3 entries.\n2. The state at 10 and 20 should contain >=3 entries. (UTXO model: at least 3 UTXO entries; account-based model: at least 3 account informations.)\n3. State should evolve: states at 0, 10, and 20 should not be exactly the same.\n4. Common prefix: since it is already graded in the previous one, we relax the grading of this item. The state at block 10 should be the same across 3 nodes. Note that your chain should already be much longer than 10 blocks.\n\n## Double check\nWe do not provide any script for this assignment. You can double-check by following these procedures (which will be our grading procedures):\n\n1. Unzip your zip file by this command: `unzip -qq netid1_netid2_netid3.zip -d netid`, make sure your code is in this directory: `netid\/COS-ECE470-fa2024-main`.\n2. Run `cargo build`, which generates `netid\/COS-ECE470-fa2024-main\/target\/debug\/bitcoin`. It is the runnable binary of your code. (Windows may have `*.exe`, and it's ok.)\n3. Run three processes of this binary and remember to give different ip\/ports to them. For example, use these 3 commands:\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6000 --api 127.0.0.1:7000`\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6001 --api 127.0.0.1:7001 -c 127.0.0.1:6000`\n- `.\/bitcoin --p2p 127.0.0.1:6002 --api 127.0.0.1:7002 -c 127.0.0.1:6001`\n4. Start mining by mining API, tx-generator by its API (theta=100), and let it run for 5 minutes.\n5. Use `\/blockchain\/state` API to get the states in 3 nodes\n6. Check whether they satisfy the aforementioned criteria.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- *How can one set up initial addresses for each node?* \n     - In the ICO, you can set addresses for each node according to deterministic keypairs using random seeds (eg: using `Ed25519KeyPair::from_seed_unchecked(&[random_seed;32]).unwrap()`)\n- *How can one pass the keypairs of addresses defined in the genesis to the transaction generators?* \n     - You could pass the respective initial keypairs to the transaction generators according to the `p2p_addr`.\n- *Is it an issue if the ordering of entries in the state api list is different across nodes?* \n     - No, we will sort the entries beforee comparison during grading.\n- *If the blockchains were in sync for the Part 7 but diverge in this part after the introduction of State, what might be the problem?* \n    - You can put print statements within the new code you added to see if a node is getting stuck somewhere (maybe waiting for a blockchain.lock() to be released). Make sure you are using `drop(mempool)` or `drop(blockchain)` if you are using a locked mempool or blockchain in your network worker, miner or transaction generator. (See [best practices](..\/Project4\/arc_mutex_best_practices.md))\n- *How can one increase the number of valid transactions in a block?* \n    - You can generate new addresses\/accounts controlled by a node within the transaction generator (and create a transaction sending coins to this new account) \n\n\n#### Note\nWe do not ask you to implement transaction fees, mining rewards, and the corresponding coinbase transaction for this project."}
