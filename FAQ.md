# Frequently Asked Questions

## Model Selection for ChatGPT:
We have received questions about accessing different models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4-mini) in the free version of ChatGPT. If your interface does not provide the option to select specific models:

No need to worry. By default, you will be using a compatible model for the project (either GPT-4 or GPT-4-mini).


## Rate Limiting Issues:
If you are experiencing rate limits or restricted message quotas:

First, please make sure that you are logged in, but you don't necessarily need to obtain a paid account. ChatGPT has extremely strict rate limits on guest users.

If you are rate limited and cannot send any message, we recommend waiting and trying again later, or using an alternate account (e.g., from a teammate).

If you face any limitations or rate restrictions on file upload, you may use the same chat link to submit multiple tasks (i.e. Upload the files in one prompt, propose your tasks one by one in the same prompt, and use the same link when submitting different tasks). 

In case you cannot complete the chat history in time due to rate limits, please submit a placeholder string in the Google form and update it later with the proper chat link. You can edit your form response after submission.


## Trouble with Chat History Sharing:
If you are having trouble sharing the chat history via the "Share" link of ChatGPT, especially if you choose to include multimedia (e.g., images, videos) in your dataset for extra credit, please feel free to take a screenshot of the chat history and upload it to a cloud storage service (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.). Then, submit the link to the file in the submission form. You can do the same for the "Desired Solution" part in the submission form.


## Scope of the Dataset:
For students working on homeworks, lectures, and beyond, it is perfectly fine and highly encouraged to add tasks in another subject which has strong connection with blockchains, but for this kind of tasks which are not blockchain-native, adding blockchain-related contexts for these tasks is preferable for an added layer of relevance.
